A project to try and get comfortable with Common Lisp's object system. I wrote the code in Python first and then translated into Lisp it so I wouldn't have to simultaneously worry about the new language and the new program. (Hence the possibly not very lisp-y code.)

I'll see if I can implement a neural net with this framework later!
